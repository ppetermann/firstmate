# Runtime backend verification

Audience: maintainer verification.

This record contains reusable version-scoped evidence for active runtime guarantees.
The backend guides own current setup, safety boundaries, and limitations.
Exact task chronology, branch names, temporary homes, local paths, process ids, thread ids, and delivery transcripts remain in private reports or PR evidence.

## tmux

Foreground-process behavior was verified on 2026-07-07 with tmux 3.6a on macOS.

```sh
tmux new-session -d -s fmtest -n testwin
tmux display-message -p -t fmtest:testwin '#{pane_current_command}'
tmux send-keys -t fmtest:testwin 'sleep 30' Enter
tmux display-message -p -t fmtest:testwin '#{pane_current_command}'
tmux send-keys -t fmtest:testwin C-c
tmux display-message -p -t fmtest:testwin '#{pane_current_command}'
```

Observed output:

```text
zsh
sleep
zsh
```

A persistent parent shell waiting for a child remained reported as the parent process, while a shell that directly execed a simple command changed identity with the process itself.
Pi and pi-signed 0.82.0 were reverified on 2026-07-27 through real isolated `fm-spawn.sh` launches.

### Agent liveness name sources

The earlier record that every harness is observed under its own `#{pane_current_command}` no longer holds and has been replaced by the per-harness evidence below.
In this macOS run that reading reflected a rewritable process title rather than stable executable identity, so it is now one of two independent name sources rather than the sole basis of a verdict.

The seven primary-capable adapters were relaunched on 2026-08-03 with tmux 3.6a on macOS 26.5.2 arm64, each on a private socket in an isolated lab.

```sh
tmux -L "$socket" new-window -d -t "$session:" -n "$harness" -c "$wt" -- "$bin"
tmux -L "$socket" display-message -p -t "$session:$harness" '#{pane_current_command}'
ps -t "${tty#/dev/}" -o pgid=,tpgid=,comm=      # rows where pgid = tpgid
```

Observed identities, and the resulting verdict:

| Harness | Version | `#{pane_current_command}` | Foreground `comm` | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| claude | 2.1.220 | `2.1.220` | `claude` | alive |
| codex | codex-cli 0.146.0 | `codex` | `codex` | alive |
| opencode | 1.18.11 | `opencode` | `opencode` | alive |
| pi | 0.82.0 | `pi-launcher` | `pi-signed`, `pi` | alive |
| pi-signed | 0.82.0 | `pi-launcher` | `pi-signed`, `pi` | alive |
| grok | 0.2.118 | `grok-0.2.118-ma` | `grok` | alive |
| kimi | 0.31.1 | `kimi` | `kimi` | alive |

Claude Code is the harness whose title no longer attributes it at all; every other adapter is currently attributed by both sources.
Codex reported `codex-aarch64-a` at 0.145.0 and `codex` at 0.146.0, and Kimi Code reported `kimi-code` as its foreground `comm` at 0.29.1 and `kimi` at 0.31.1, so these identities move between ordinary patch releases in both directions.
That is the evidence for treating any single process name as a surface under vendor control rather than a stable contract.

The crewmate-only Muse Code 0.1.0-R708.1 adapter was verified separately on 2026-08-05 against tmux on macOS arm64.
Its installed `muse-bin-0.1.0-R708.1` foreground identity classified `alive`, while `musescore`, `amuse`, `muse-binary`, and `muse-bind` remained ambiguous in the portable regression.
[`muse.md`](muse.md#process-identity) owns the artifact identity and launcher evidence for that verification.

Bounded observed output:

```text
foreground comms:
  zsh
  .../instbin/muse-bin-0.1.0-R708.1
classify each:
  zsh                            -> shell
  muse-bin-0.1.0-R708.1          -> agent
fm_backend_agent_state tmux museliv:zsh
alive
```

`#{pane_current_command}` and foreground `ps -o comm=` read different name fields, but which one preserves executable identity is platform-dependent.
On macOS the pane command reflected the rewritable title while the full install path could survive in `ps -o comm=`; in the Linux portable regression those roles reversed for the version-named native executable, with the identifying path retained in argv[0].
The classifier therefore accepts a harness basename first, then an exact harness path component in the full executable path, then the same component in argv[0], without depending on which field carries it on a given platform.

The portable regression is CI-enforced, while the real-harness drift guard is opt-in under the policy in `.agents/skills/firstmate-coding-guidelines/SKILL.md`.
Run the live guard after any harness upgrade and before trusting or refreshing the table above:

```sh
FM_HARNESS_LIVENESS_DRIFT=1 bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-harness-liveness-drift-live-e2e.test.sh
```

Bounded output from the run that produced the table:

```text
ok - harness liveness: claude 2.1.220 (Claude Code) classifies alive
# claude 2.1.220 (Claude Code): title='2.1.220' foreground=[claude ]
# checked 7 installed harness(es)
```

Installed-wrapper checks:

```sh
basename "$(command -v pi-signed)"
pi-signed --version
pi --version
```

Observed bounded output:

```text
pi-signed
0.82.0
0.82.0
```

The isolated process and endpoint checks used:

```sh
tmux display-message -p -t "$target" '#{pane_current_command}'
ps -o comm= -p "$wrapper_pid"
ps -o comm= -p "$engine_pid"
FM_HOME="$fixture_home" bin/fm-crew-state.sh "$task_id"
```

Observed bounded shapes:

```text
pi-launcher
.../pi-signed
.../Pi Launcher.app/Contents/Resources/pi/pi
state: done ...
```

Both launches executed a submitted tool instruction and touched the generated `turn_end` marker.
The pi-signed launch retained `harness=pi-signed`, while the plain comparison retained `harness=pi`.
The exact wrapper ancestry was `pi-signed` parent to Pi engine child, and the plain Pi Launcher path also traversed the signed wrapper on this installation.
That shared plain-Pi path is retained as disconfirming evidence against using ancestry as runtime-selection authority.
Firstmate therefore sets the exact `FM_PI_HARNESS` selection marker on both worker launch paths, while an unmarked Pi-family process remains `pi`.
Both recorded runtime identities now classify the exact `pi-launcher` foreground command as `alive`.

Backend applicability was reviewed across every spawn adapter.
Tmux needs the exact `pi-launcher`, `pi-signed`, `pi`, and `Pi` process identities for recovery-grade liveness.
Herdr uses native registered-agent state and needs no process-name branch.
Zellij has no verified recovery-grade agent process probe, while Orca and cmux do not support secondmate spawns, so those three retain their existing generic ordinary-launch semantics without a new liveness matcher.

The structural multi-row composer reader, Kimi pointer-delivery path, and OpenCode 1.18.4 busy-queue behavior are pinned by:

```sh
tests/fm-composer-ghost.test.sh
tests/fm-composer-pane-shapes.test.sh
tests/fm-kimi-harness.test.sh
tests/fm-tmux-submit-busy.test.sh
```

Expected structural matrix: real text on any content row is pending; all-empty complete boxes are empty; a left rail proven by an aligned repeated box-drawing bar is read from its top through the cursor row; unreadable, incomplete, or unsafe boxes are unknown, including when their unpaired side rows would otherwise read as a rail (a run of aligned bars bounded at either end by a corner row or a paired side row of the same family and indent stays with the box verdict, at any run depth); and non-bordered panes retain cursor-row compatibility.
Expected submit matrix: proven pending plus busy is accepted as queued; proven pending plus idle remains pending; ambiguous pending is never converted by the busy exception; an unreadable composer reports `unknown-but-turn-started` or `unknown-idle-no-delivery` and never succeeds; and only a proven empty composer succeeds directly.

### Composer shapes per harness

Composer rendering is a vendor-controlled surface, and both current primary shapes were measured on 2026-08-09 with tmux 3.2a on Linux, in 80x24 panes with no attached client.

```sh
FM_COMPOSER_DRIFT=1 tests/fm-composer-drift-live-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
ok - composer drift: claude 2.1.226 (Claude Code) separates an empty composer from unsubmitted text
ok - composer drift: opencode 1.18.15 separates an empty composer from unsubmitted text
# unverified on this machine (not installed): codex pi pi-signed grok kimi muse
# checked 2 installed harness(es)
```

Claude 2.1.226 draws no bordered composer box at all: its input area is a bare `❯` row between two full-width `─` rules, and the empty composer's cursor row is exactly `❯` plus one U+00A0 (captured bytes `e2 9d af c2 a0`).
OpenCode 1.18.4 and 1.18.15 draw a left rail only: consecutive rows led by U+2503 at a shared indent, with no right border, no corner rows, and a U+2579 cap beneath; the last rail row is the model and mode status line rather than input.
OpenCode's idle placeholder is truecolor `38;2;128;128;128` against `38;2;238;238;238` for real typed input, which is why the ghost-luminance bound is inclusive.
The two OpenCode releases render identically, so the OpenCode reader change was not driven by a vendor change.

That command is what refreshes this section; run it after any harness upgrade and before trusting the shapes recorded above.

### Cleanup endpoint identity

The cleanup identity boundary was validated on 2026-07-28 with tmux 3.6a and metadata fixtures for every supported backend.

```sh
tests/fm-teardown-endpoint-safety.test.sh
tests/fm-teardown.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-zellij.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-orca.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-cmux.test.sh
```

Bounded output from the incident regression:

```text
ok - fm-teardown: missing, empty, malformed, ambiguous, and task-mismatched endpoints refuse before every mutation or runtime call
ok - cleanup identity: valid tmux, Herdr, Zellij, Orca, and cmux records validate while every empty backend target refuses
ok - tmux backend: direct empty target returns nonzero without invoking tmux
ok - process cleanup: creation-time PID identity removes only the exact child and preserves the control child
ok - fm-teardown: dedicated-socket invalid cleanup preserves target/control and valid cleanup removes only the exact target
```

The dedicated tmux cell removed ambient tmux variables, required a socket-bound wrapper, kept one target and one independent control window, and proved the wrapper was not called for invalid metadata or a direct empty target.
Valid cleanup removed only the exact task-bound target and left the control window live.
The metadata-only validation covers tmux, Herdr, Zellij, Orca, and cmux before backend dispatch.
Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, pi-signed, Grok, Kimi, and Muse share that backend cleanup boundary; their harness-specific hook files, tokens, and session-log sidecars are cleaned only after it, so no harness needs a separate endpoint parser.

## Herdr

The compatibility floor is protocol 14.
The whole real-Herdr lane's latest active verification uses both Herdr 0.7.4 protocol 16 and Herdr 0.8.0 protocol 19 on macOS aarch64, while focused Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 17, earlier protocol-16, protocol-14, and 0.7.3 evidence is retained where it defines current behavior or fallbacks.
Protocol 17 keeps every protocol-16 feature gate satisfied; the event and workspace-move floors remain 16.
Default-on presentation projection has its own floor at Herdr 0.8.0, protocol 19, verified below.

Core read-only probes:

```sh
herdr --version
herdr status --json | jq -c '{client:.client.protocol,server:.server.protocol}'
herdr api schema --json | jq -c '.schemas.subscription_event["$defs"].SubscriptionEventKind.enum'
```

Observed protocol-16 compatibility shapes:

```text
herdr 0.7.5
{"client":17,"server":17}
["pane.output_matched","pane.agent_status_changed","pane.scroll_changed"]
```

The CLI matrix was checked directly:

| Guarantee | Command shape | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit session routing | `herdr <verb> ... --session <name>` | Reached the named session even while another server was running. |
| Literal send | `herdr pane send-text <pane> <text> --session <name>` | Left text unsubmitted until Enter. |
| Keys | `herdr pane send-keys <pane> enter|escape|ctrl+c --session <name>` | Enter and Escape worked; Ctrl-C interrupted foreground work. |
| Capture | `herdr pane read <pane> --source recent --lines N` | Small N could return empty below viewport height; a 200-line request plus local trim was stable. |
| Native state | `herdr agent get <pane>` | Working and done transitions were visible; native `busy` remains positive activity evidence, while native `idle` cannot close a turn and the adapter's semantic lifecycle decides worker state. |
| Restart | guarded named-session stop then start | Workspace, tab, pane, and labels persisted; the agent process and registration did not. |
| Close | `herdr pane close <pane> --session <name>` | The exact one-pane task tab closed; closing a final tab could remove the workspace. |

All destructive verification used `bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh` with a non-default `fm-lab-` name and a byte-identical default-session tripwire.
No ambient `herdr server stop` command is a supported test operation.

### Prune and respawn

The real label-collision reproduction is owned by:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-prune-safety-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: a pre-existing captain-owned workspace with a seed-shaped tab was adopted for routing but its tab was never eligible for prune because the current create call did not return that seed id.

Restart-husk replacement is owned by:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-respawn-idem-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: a restored no-agent tab was replaced create-before-close, while a registered live agent caused refusal.

### Launcher workspace placement

Herdr exports its pane identity into every process it manages, checked on 2026-07-30 against Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 17 inside a guarded lab pane:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh
"$HERDR_LAB_HELPER" run "$LAB" pane run "$PANE" "sh -c 'env | grep ^HERDR | sort > /tmp/env.txt'"
```

```text
HERDR_ENV=1
HERDR_PANE_ID=w1:p1
HERDR_SESSION=fm-lab-fm-herdr-env-pro-65961-25535
HERDR_SOCKET_PATH=/Users/kunchen/.config/herdr/sessions/fm-lab-fm-herdr-env-pro-65961-25535/herdr.sock
HERDR_TAB_ID=w1:t1
HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID=w1
```

This complete injection shape is verified only for Herdr 0.7.5.
Firstmate requires both `HERDR_PANE_ID` and `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` before accepting claimed launcher ancestry.

`pane get` reports the pane's current owning tab and workspace, which is what placement resolves from; the injected `HERDR_TAB_ID` and `HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID` are creation-time snapshots and are not read as current identity:

```sh
"$HERDR_LAB_HELPER" run "$LAB" pane get w1:p1 | jq -c '.result.pane | {pane_id,tab_id,workspace_id}'
```

```text
{"pane_id":"w1:p1","tab_id":"w1:t1","workspace_id":"w1"}
```

Placement is owned by:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-launcher-workspace-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantees on 2026-07-30 against Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 17:

```text
ok - real herdr E2E: with one 'firstmate' workspace and no herdr parent, a crewmate still lands in this home's own workspace without stealing focus
ok - real herdr E2E: the normal unique-label path is unchanged when the launcher's own pane identifies the workspace
ok - real herdr E2E: presentation spaces still create the isolated child workspace and bind it under the launcher's exact parent, without stealing focus
ok - real herdr E2E: with two 'firstmate' workspaces, a worker spawned from inside the second one lands in that exact workspace
ok - real herdr E2E: the duplicate-labeled sibling workspace is left entirely untouched and focus is preserved
ok - real herdr E2E: with a duplicated home label, a projected worker still hangs off the launcher's exact workspace and the sibling stays untouched
ok - real herdr E2E: an ambiguous home label with no launcher identity refuses before any worker endpoint exists
ok - real herdr E2E: a launcher pane that no longer exists refuses before any worker endpoint exists
ok - real herdr E2E: a secondmate launching its own worker gets the same exact-workspace guarantee, and its same-labeled sibling is untouched
ok - real herdr E2E: a --secondmate launch still stands up that secondmate's own workspace instead of inheriting the launcher's
ok - real herdr E2E: teardown closes only the worker's own pane and leaves the launcher, its workspace, and the same-labeled sibling intact
```

That suite's headline case runs `bin/fm-spawn.sh` inside a real Herdr pane, so the parent identity comes from Herdr's own injection rather than a composed environment.
Cross-session and contradictory bindings are covered deterministically in `tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh`, which can script a second server's socket without provisioning one.

### Per-home and presentation topology

Per-home behavior is owned by:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-workspace-per-home-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: the primary and secondmate used distinct home workspaces, a child launched by the secondmate stayed in that secondmate workspace, list-live remained home-scoped, and exact cleanup did not affect sibling homes.

The complete projection suite ran on 2026-07-21 against Herdr 0.7.4 protocol 16:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-presentation-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantees included:

```text
ok - real Herdr lab: primary and two secondmate homes each own a top-level contiguous child block
ok - real Herdr lab: concurrent primary/A/B spawns stay session-locked with zero focus drift
ok - real Herdr lab: session lock contention from a secondmate home falls back flat with no journal
ok - real Herdr lab: legacy projection labels and flat secondmate tabs are left unmigrated
ok - real Herdr lab: multi-home exact-pane teardowns restore captain focus without workspace close authority
ok - real Herdr lab validation completed on Herdr 0.7.4 with the default-session tripwire intact
```

The suite also covers lost or failed move responses, active-tab refusal, restart husks, missing and duplicate tokens, manual renames, concurrent cleanup, and exact focus restoration.

The mandatory projection suite ran again on 2026-07-24 against Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 16:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-presentation-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed restart-reclaim guarantees:

```text
ok - real Herdr lab: Hi Bit and Wheelhouse-style same-identity restarts reclaim one nested space with exact focus and idempotence
ok - real Herdr lab: secondmate restart binding and reclaim stay isolated to the exact child home and parent
ok - real Herdr lab: concurrent cross-home recoveries replace exact husks under one session lock with no focus drift
ok - real Herdr lab: missing, renamed, and duplicate tokens trigger zero destructive or adoptive calls, and live duplicate risk refuses launch
ok - real Herdr lab validation completed on Herdr 0.7.5 with the default-session tripwire intact
```

The projection suite ran again on 2026-08-04 against Herdr 0.8.0 protocol 19 for the default-on flip, where an absent `config/herdr-presentation-spaces` enables the projection and the value `off` opts out; since 2026-08-05 an absent file enables the projection only at or above the 0.8.0 floor recorded under "Presentation version floor" below, and `on` is the explicit opt-in that survives the floor:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-presentation-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed default and opt-out guarantees:

```text
ok - real Herdr lab: an opted-out spawn retains the Stage 1 Herdr command sequence with zero ordering calls
ok - real Herdr lab: a home that configured nothing is projected by default
ok - real Herdr lab: the primary presentation setting inherits into real secondmate homes
ok - real Herdr lab validation completed on Herdr 0.8.0 with the default-session tripwire intact
```

The projected spawn in that run used the historical empty opt-in file, so a home that had already enabled the projection keeps it without any migration step.
One concurrent cross-home recovery case refused under contention on a loaded machine and passed on an immediate rerun; recovery-path presentation lock contention is a deliberate hard refusal rather than a flat fallback, which default-on now makes reachable from any Herdr home.
That run measured the default-on projection on Herdr 0.8.0 only, while the focus-flash regression below was last run on 0.7.5 before the flip, so neither run covered a defective release under default-on projection; the version floor and the focus-flash suite's Part C close that gap.

The restored-shell session-start cleanup ran on 2026-07-24 against Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 17:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-herdr-session-cleanup-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: one exact home-local, journal-correlated, one-tab and one-pane childless idle shell was closed after restoration while the exact non-target focus and default fleet session remained unchanged, and a repeat run was a no-op.

### Workspace-removal focus safety

The focus-flash regression ran on 2026-08-05 against both Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 17 and Herdr 0.8.0 protocol 19 on macOS aarch64, with the 0.7.5 run using the pinned upstream release binary first on `PATH`:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-focus-flash-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed output on Herdr 0.7.5:

```text
ok - old path: the explicit last-pane close of a non-focused workspace stole focus (w3	w3:t1 -> w2	w2:t1)
ok - mitigation: every in-operation sample preserved exact focus while the doomed workspace was removed
ok - mitigation: no explicit close and no corrective focus were needed on the defective release
ok - fallback: a doomed pane holding a persistent child exhausts the proof and takes the plain explicit close
ok - fallback on a defective release: a bounded wrong-focus window of 4 samples was fully restored to the anchor
ok - version floor: herdr 0.7.5 protocol 17 remains conservatively below the floor with steal_live=1
ok - version floor: an unconfigured home falls back flat on herdr 0.7.5 and the explicit opt-in still projects
evidence: herdr=0.7.5 protocol=17 steal_live=1 floor_verdict=1 default-session-tripwire=armed
```

Observed output on Herdr 0.8.0:

```text
ok - old path note: this Herdr release preserves focus across the explicit close; continuing with outcome-only assertions
ok - mitigation: every in-operation sample preserved exact focus while the doomed workspace was removed
ok - fallback: a doomed pane holding a persistent child exhausts the proof and takes the plain explicit close
ok - fallback on a focus-preserving release: the plain explicit close preserved exact focus throughout
ok - version floor: herdr 0.8.0 protocol 19 is at or above the floor and preserves focus
ok - version floor: an unconfigured home stays projected on herdr 0.8.0 and the explicit opt-in agrees
evidence: herdr=0.8.0 protocol=19 steal_live=0 floor_verdict=0 default-session-tripwire=armed
```

Part C is the case the suite could not reach before: a doomed pane whose shell holds a persistent background child fails the lone-idle-shell proof on every sample, so the plan takes the plain explicit close, in the geometry where the closing workspace's right neighbour is a spacer rather than the focused anchor.
On 0.7.5 that fallback exposed a bounded four-sample wrong-focus window and restored the anchor exactly; on 0.8.0 the same fallback exposed none, which is why default-on projection is floored at 0.8.0 rather than mitigated further below it.
The suite also cross-checks its own Part A measurement against the floor classifier on whatever release it runs, so a drifted protocol-to-release mapping fails there rather than silently gating on the wrong thing.

### Presentation version floor

Default-on presentation projection is floored at Herdr 0.8.0.
The floor's structural signal is the selected running server's protocol number, falling back to the client protocol only when that selected session positively reports no running server, and the release mapping was measured on 2026-08-05 by running each pinned upstream macOS aarch64 release asset's own `status --json` through the guarded lab helper:

| Release | Reported version | Protocol | Carries both upstream focus fixes | Floor verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v0.7.3 | 0.7.3 | 16 | no | below |
| v0.7.4 | 0.7.4 | 16 | no | below |
| v0.7.5 | 0.7.5 | 17 | no | below |
| preview-2026-07-21-0f10e1453a7f | 0.7.5-preview.2026-07-21-0f10e1453a7f | 17 | no | below |
| preview-2026-07-29-44b3adb12552 | 0.7.5-preview.2026-07-29-44b3adb12552 | 18 | yes | below |
| preview-2026-08-04-d78e3d3b5126 | 0.8.0-preview.2026-08-04-d78e3d3b5126 | 19 | yes | above |
| v0.8.0 | 0.8.0 | 19 | yes | above |

No build lacking both fixes reaches protocol 19, and every pre-fix build tops out at 17, so protocol 19 is a safe structural expression of the 0.8.0 floor.
The one post-fix build below it is a preview that still reports a 0.7.5 version, so it is conservatively treated as below the floor, which costs a preview build its projection and never lets an unfixed build through.
The 2026-08-05 named-lab cross-version probe started a server from Herdr 0.7.5 and queried it with the installed 0.8.0 client; status reported client version 0.8.0 protocol 19, server version 0.7.5 protocol 17, server running true, and server compatible false.
That ordinary post-upgrade shape proves the running server owns the focus behavior, so the unconfigured default composes client and selected-server verdicts conservatively and rechecks after server ensure before publishing a journal or creating a workspace.

Refresh this table with the opt-in guard, which re-downloads the pinned assets, verifies their digests, and fails naming any release whose reported version, protocol, or verdict has moved:

```sh
FM_HERDR_VERSION_FLOOR_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-herdr-version-floor-live-e2e.test.sh
```

The classifier itself, the config preference it composes with, and the one-warning-per-release behavior are pinned portably with no Herdr installed:

```sh
tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh
```

Observed guarantees: every measured release classifies as the table records; either the protocol or the version signal alone carries an at-or-above verdict, and each divergent pair flips once the carrying signal is removed; client and running selected-session server verdicts compose conservatively, an unreadable server-running state and losing both release signals report indeterminate and fall back flat, the default is rechecked after server ensure before projection publication, an unconfigured home is projected only at or above the floor, an explicit `on`, including the historical empty opt-in file, is honored below it, and the below-floor warning is emitted once per home per detected release rather than once per spawn.

The whole real-Herdr lane was run on 2026-08-05 against both the CI-pinned Herdr 0.7.4 protocol 16, which is below the floor, and Herdr 0.8.0 protocol 19, which is at it:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh bin/fm-test-run.sh --lane real-herdr-gated
```

Both runs reported `family=real-herdr-gated count=11 failed=0`.
The projection suite's unconfigured-home case is release-aware rather than pinned to one outcome, so it proves the projected default on 0.8.0 and the flat fallback with its naming warning on 0.7.4:

```text
ok - real Herdr lab: a home that configured nothing is projected by default on herdr 0.8.0
ok - real Herdr lab: a home that configured nothing falls back flat on below-floor herdr 0.7.4 with one naming warning
```

Every other case in that suite uses an explicit opt-in or opt-out, so the floor leaves them unchanged on both releases.

Direct lab probes on 2026-07-28 established the removal rules the emptying-close plan relies on, each verified with `workspace list` focus reads around one mutation in a guarded `fm-lab-` session:

- An explicit `pane close` that emptied a non-focused workspace moved focus off the focused workspace in both before-focus and after-focus geometries.
- Ending a workspace's lone shell preserved the focused workspace exactly when the dying workspace sat behind it or the focused workspace was last, and moved focus to the focused workspace's right neighbor otherwise.
- The production focus-preserving close in the dangerous geometry repositioned the doomed workspace, ended its proved shell, and left every concurrent focus sample on the exact anchor with no corrective `tab focus` issued.

Two real-hardware conditions were required for the pane-death path to engage and are now encoded in the adapter and its unit fixtures: BSD `ps` reports a login shell's `comm` as `-zsh`, and an idle shell transiently hosts a prompt helper (starship) as a second foreground process immediately after a `workspace.move` relayout, which the bounded settle window absorbs.

The rules match the v0.7.5 tag source (`close_selected_workspace` reassigns focus from the closing workspace's index; `handle_pane_died` only clamps the stale focused index), and the upstream default branch resolves both paths by workspace id (PR #1877, commit `165dca45`, for the explicit close; PR #1912, commit `a979916`, for pane death), so the plan degrades to a harmless reorder-then-remove once a release carries them.

The full projection and restored-shell suites were re-run on 2026-07-28 on Herdr 0.7.5 with the updated close path; the presentation suite completed with `real Herdr lab validation completed on Herdr 0.7.5 with the default-session tripwire intact`, and the restored-shell cleanup guarantee above was unchanged.

The teardown-level record-retention gate was verified on 2026-07-28 with metadata fixtures and a live contending lock holder:

```sh
tests/fm-teardown.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh
```

Observed guarantees: a contended presentation lock refused the teardown before the isolated copy was returned, with the task branch, every durable record, and the endpoint intact and no pane close attempted; the retry after the contention cleared returned the copy, closed the pane under the lock, and removed the records; an unknown structured-presence result after an attempted projected close retained the journal and every record with a nonzero exit; and every presence-gate mode accepted only a structured not-found as gone.

The same fixtures verified three further boundaries on 2026-07-29: missing or malformed endpoint identity and an unparseable pane presence refused record removal with everything retained; the SIGKILL escalation re-read the exact pane's process information and refused to signal when a different shell pid owned the pane, falling back to the plain close with the original process untouched; and a reposition whose removal then failed on every path restored the exact original workspace order through a second verified move and reported the close as failed.

The teardown fixture was re-run on 2026-07-31 after extending the same fail-closed boundary through forced secondmate cleanup, including recursive cleanup of a nested secondmate whose Herdr grandchild close remains unconfirmed.

Observed output:

```text
ok - forced secondmate teardown preflights every Herdr child before cleanup mutation
ok - forced secondmate teardown retains Herdr child identity until exact pane disappearance
ok - forced teardown retains a nested secondmate home and its grandchild's Herdr identity when the grandchild close is unconfirmed
```

### Composer and operational input

Real captures verified these active distinctions:

- Claude and Codex use bare `❯` and `›` agent composers.
  Claude's row carries further rule-delimited structure this reader depends on; [Away-mode transport](#away-mode-transport) below owns that shape and the delivery failure it caused.
- Unicode blank padding around a prompt glyph is padding, not typed input, because no shell trim treats U+00A0 as whitespace.
- OpenCode uses a left-rail composer container with no right border and no corner rows.
- Pi uses content between complete separator rows and requires exact native Pi identity.
- Dim or faint suggestion text is ghost content, while normally styled text is pending input.
- Grok dark truecolor placeholders are ghost content, while bright truecolor typed input remains pending.
- A bare shell prompt has no safe agent-composer container and is unknown.

`tests/fm-composer-ghost.test.sh`, `tests/fm-composer-lib.test.sh`, `tests/fm-composer-pane-shapes.test.sh`, and the Herdr composer cases pin the exact captured ANSI bytes.
The U+2063 operational and routed-request separators were exercised through a real Pi-on-Herdr path; the byte-exact active regression is:

```sh
FM_SEND_MARKER_HERDR_E2E=1 \
  tests/fm-send-secondmate-marker-herdr-e2e.test.sh
```

### Native blocked event

The protocol-16 event path was measured on 2026-07-11 with Herdr 0.7.3 and Python 3.13:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-eventwait-smoke.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
ok - real herdr: events.subscribe capability gate passes
ok - real herdr: a driven idle->blocked transition returns the blocked record in 0.129s
ok - real herdr: the watcher fast-path enqueues a stale wake naming the task window
```

Polling remained active and is covered as the fallback for capability, connect, subscribe, and repeated reader failure.

### Agent lifecycle control

Herdr is one of the two backends whose recovery-grade agent-state classifier the control plane may trust ([agent-control.md](../agent-control.md)), so its lifecycle gating is measured against the real binary; reverified 2026-08-08 on Herdr 0.8.0, and first measured 2026-08-02 on Herdr 0.7.5 with identical results:

```sh
tests/fm-control-herdr-smoke.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
ok - real herdr: exit on a pane with no registered agent is idempotent success
ok - real herdr: interrupt refuses when herdr's own agent registry reports no agent
ok - real herdr: interrupt delivers the harness's key and proves the agent survived it
ok - real herdr: no control verb removed the endpoint or the task's local copy
ok - real herdr: an agent that does not stop fails closed instead of being reported as stopped
```

The registry read through `herdr pane report-agent` is the same source `fm_backend_herdr_agent_state` classifies, so registering and not registering an agent on a plain shell pane exercises exactly the gate every lifecycle verb depends on, with no real agent launched.
That command is the guard that refreshes this record; run it after every Herdr upgrade rather than trusting the version above.

### Away-mode transport

The Pi/Herdr return and injection path was reverified on Herdr 0.7.3 and Pi 0.80.7:

```sh
FM_AFK_PI_HERDR_E2E=1 HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-afk-pi-herdr-return-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantees: pending composer input refused injection and raised one alert; idle Pi accepted one marked escalation; the return gate refused ordinary work while a live blocker remained; resolving the blocker allowed the return flow.
The dedicated Herdr daemon workspace topology is covered by `tests/fm-afk-launch.test.sh` and preserves the captain tab's pane count.

#### claude's rule-delimited composer (2026-08-10, claude 2.1.226 on Herdr 0.8.0)

claude delimits its composer with a horizontal rule above and below rather than a box.
While both rules are plain `─` runs they form a complete separator pair enclosing the composer row, and the reader was already correct.
Once the pane is wide enough claude inlines its in-progress todo into the TOP rule, which stops that rule being plain, leaves claude's own CLOSING rule unmatched below the live composer, and made the reader answer `unknown`.
The away-mode injector requires an affirmative `empty`, so every escalation deferred to the max-defer wedge alarm on an idle, injectable pane.

Measured read-only on the captain's pane at 107 columns:

```text
row 1  ───────────────…─────────── Run tests ──   (107 cols, NOT a plain rule)
row 2  ❯<U+00A0>                                  (ESC[38;2;153;153;153m)
row 3  ───────────────…──────────────────────────  (107 cols, plain rule)
row 4    ⏵⏵ auto mode on (shift+tab to cycle) · ← for agents · esc to interrupt
```

A headless lab session has no attached client and its panes are fixed at the default grid, measured as 54 columns on Herdr 0.8.0 (`herdr pane layout` reported `{"height":23,"width":54,"x":26,"y":1}`, and `tput cols` inside the pane agreed).
`COLUMNS`, a wide controlling PTY, and `herdr pane zoom` all left that unchanged, and at 54 columns claude renders the same todo as separate rows above a plain top rule.
The wide-pane label therefore cannot be redrawn in an isolated lab; the guard below pins the verdicts and the structural invariants instead.

The reader keeps the composer's verdict only when both the closing rule is the composer row's immediate successor and `herdr agent get` names a known non-Pi agent.
Both signals were confirmed live: `agent get` reported `claude` for a launched claude pane and returned no agent for a plain shell pane in the same session.

The identity half rests on an exited agent LOSING that record, measured against a real exit rather than against a pane that never hosted an agent.
Method: a claude pane launched in an isolated lab session, read with `fm_backend_herdr_composer_state` and `herdr agent get` before and after its `/exit` quit command.

| Moment | `composer_state` | `agent get` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| claude running, idle composer | `empty` | `agent=claude`, `agent_status=idle` |
| ~8s after the quit command | `unknown` | agent absent, status absent |
| 20s after the quit command | `unknown` | agent absent, status absent |

That first post-exit sample was taken at about 8 seconds, which bounds the drop only loosely.
Three further consecutive runs tightened it: the record was already absent at the FIRST sample, taken 0.05 seconds after `pane process-info` showed the pane's shell back in the foreground, so no clearing lag was observed at all.
The guard still polls for the record to clear rather than reading it once, because Herdr's agent state is event-driven (`pane.agent_status_changed`) and a slower or loaded machine is not bound by these measurements.

`pane process-info` returned the foreground process to the shell (foreground pid equal to `shell_pid`, name `zsh`), and the screen after exit showed only the shell prompt because claude restored the normal screen buffer.
So no stale glyph row and no rule survived at all, and Herdr had already dropped the record: two independent reasons the rescue cannot fire on an exited agent.

Both ways of submitting that quit command were measured, and both quit claude cleanly, each settling the pane back to its shell, dropping the native agent record, and leaving `composer_state` reading `unknown`: Herdr's atomic `pane run`, and the popup-safe order of a literal send, a 1.2 second settle, then a retried Enter.
The guard uses the popup-safe order regardless, because a `/`-prefixed send opens a completion popup this repo already guards against everywhere else, not because the atomic path was ever observed failing.

```sh
tests/fm-afk-inject-herdr-e2e.test.sh
FM_COMPOSER_DRIFT=1 tests/fm-herdr-composer-drift-live-e2e.test.sh
```

Scenario E of the injection e2e drives the real daemon over the real Herdr transport against the captain's exact frame.
Against the pre-fix reader it reproduced the wedge (`reads 'unknown', not empty`); with the fix it delivered exactly one escalation and raised no wedge alarm.

The drift guard launches every installed harness in an isolated lab session and holds each to its empty, pending, and empty-again verdict checks plus the structural frame.
At the lab's 54 columns both of claude's rules are plain, so the separator pair completes and the reader answers without the rescue at all; the guard observes the frame there but deliberately does not gate on the adjacency and native-identity invariants, because asserting them where the reader does not consult them would abort claiming the wedge is back for a pane the same run had just affirmed as `empty`.
The wide-pane labelled shape, where the rescue is load-bearing, is pinned by the portable cases in `tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh` and by Scenario E instead.
The guard cannot itself redraw the wide-pane label, so it does not fail against the pre-fix reader; the portable cases and Scenario E are what fail pre-fix, and the guard covers the vendor drift neither of them can see.
Its dead-shell control, a pane in the same session running only a login shell, read `unknown` with no native agent record, so the emptiness above was not bought by weakening the refusal that keeps an escalation out of a shell.
It also launched opencode 1.18.16 and re-confirmed the left-rail composer limitation recorded in [`docs/herdr-backend.md`](../herdr-backend.md) still reads `unknown`, so away-mode delivery to opencode on Herdr remains unverified.
That is the guard's one known-gap entry, and the guard fails asking for the entry to be removed if a listed harness starts reading correctly, so the list cannot outlive the limitation.
Herdr names its backspace key `backspace` and refuses tmux's `BSpace` with `invalid_key`.

Observed against installed harnesses as of this commit: the dead-shell control, claude's empty, pending and empty-again verdicts, the frame observation above, and opencode's standing gap.
NOT yet observed: the guard's exited-agent control is newly added and has never run as part of a full guard run, so read claude's pass as covering the verdicts and the frame and never that control.
The premise that control checks is evidence-backed by the measurement table above, and from the next run on the guard re-checks it live for every harness whose quit command it has measured, reporting a harness without one as skipped rather than assuming it.

This section records durable facts, exact versions, and the commands that reproduce them, and deliberately does not quote the guards' own run-note text.
The repo asks a maintainer-verification record to carry exact dates, versions, commands and output, and this one still does for every GUARANTEE.
What is left out on purpose is incidental per-run note wording, which supports no guarantee and goes stale the moment the guard rephrases itself; the guard owns its output, and duplicating it here is what kept this record wrong.
These commands are what refresh this record; run them after every claude or Herdr upgrade rather than trusting the versions above.

## Zellij

The current compatibility floor and latest verification are Zellij 0.44.0 with `jq` on macOS aarch64.
All real tests use a uniquely named session and `tests/zellij-test-safety.sh`; they never touch a session named `firstmate` or call all-session deletion.

| Guarantee | Command shape | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Headless session | `zellij attach -b <name>` without a TTY | Created a persistent background session and returned. |
| Session list | `zellij list-sessions --short --no-formatting` | Returned one plain name per line without starting a session. |
| Create tab | `zellij action new-tab --cwd <dir> --name <title>` | Returned a numeric tab id and focused the new tab when a client was attached. |
| Pane discovery | `zellij action list-panes --json` | Included terminal pane id, tab id, plugin flag, and top-level `pane_cwd`. |
| Literal send | `zellij action paste --pane-id <id> -- <text>` | Left text unsubmitted. |
| Keys | `send-keys --pane-id <id> Enter`, `Esc`, and one argument `Ctrl c` | All three shared operations worked. |
| Capture | `dump-screen --pane-id <id>` or `--full` | Worked with no attached client; no line-bound flag exists. |
| Close | `close-tab-by-id <id>` | Removed the live task pane and tab together. |
| Failure exit | actions against missing targets | Returned exit 0, requiring structural preflight and output-shape validation. |

`pane_cwd` stayed frozen when a foreground subshell changed directory.
The marker-delimited `pwd` probe returned the live nested cwd and is covered by the real smoke.
The focus mitigation restored the previously active tab after `new-tab`, with the unavoidable narrow race documented in the operator guide.

```sh
tests/fm-backend-zellij.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-zellij-smoke.test.sh
```

The real lifecycle smoke proved spawn, metadata, nested-subshell worktree discovery, send, capture, unlanded-work refusal, approved local landing, exact tab cleanup, and session cleanup without retaining task-specific ids or branch names here.

## Orca

Real readiness was verified against `/usr/local/bin/orca` with `/Applications/Orca.app` bundle version 1.4.116.

```sh
orca status --json
```

Observed fields:

```text
result.runtime.reachable=true
result.runtime.state=ready
```

`orca terminal create --json` returned `result.terminal.handle`.
`orca worktree create` returned `result.worktree.id` and `result.worktree.path`.
Speculative bare ids and nested terminal fields were deliberately rejected.

```sh
tests/fm-backend-orca.test.sh
tests/fm-backend.test.sh
tests/fm-bootstrap.test.sh
```

The fake-Orca suite covers readiness, registration, create response parsing, metadata routing, popup-safe submit, and path-matched release refusal.

## cmux

The current compatibility floor is cmux 0.64, and the active live evidence uses 0.64.17 build 97 on macOS aarch64.
Real tests use only exact `fm-test-` workspaces guarded by `tests/cmux-test-safety.sh` and never quit or relaunch the captain's app.

```sh
cmux version
cmux ping
```

Observed version:

```text
cmux 0.64.17 (97) [9ed29d81a]
```

Source and live checks established the five control modes:

- `off` starts no listener.
- `cmuxOnly` rejects an external Firstmate process by ancestry.
- `automation` uses an owner-only 0600 socket with no handshake.
- `password` uses the same 0600 socket plus `auth <password>`.
- `allowAll` uses a 0666 socket with no authentication.

The live default rejection was `Access denied - only processes started inside cmux can connect`.
The live password challenge was `Authentication required - send auth <password> first`.
The app configuration writer did not retain a hand-added socket password, which is why the operator guide requires Settings and a local Firstmate password source.

Current active CLI findings:

| Guarantee | Command shape | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create | `new-workspace --name <title> --cwd <dir> --focus false --id-format uuids` | Created one workspace with one surface without focusing it. |
| Fresh readiness | `list-panes --workspace <id> --json --id-format uuids` | Found a brand-new surface before content existed. |
| Fresh read counterexample | `read-screen` before any write | Returned `internal_error: Failed to read terminal text`. |
| Literal send | `send --workspace <id> --surface <id> -- <text>` | Left text unsubmitted. |
| Keys | `send-key ... enter|escape|ctrl-c` | All shared key operations worked. |
| Nested cwd | `current_directory` plus foreground subshell | Structured cwd froze; the marker-delimited `pwd` probe found the live cwd. |
| Last surface | `close-surface` on the only surface | Refused with `invalid_state: Cannot close the last surface`. |
| Last workspace | `close-workspace` on the only workspace in a window | Printed success but left the workspace present. |

The last-workspace workaround was reverified on 2026-07-10 in Automation mode.
After creating one unfocused unnamed sibling in the same window, `close-workspace` removed the exact task workspace and left only cmux's default sibling.
A selected non-last workspace closed directly, proving that window cardinality rather than selection is the trigger.

Source inspection confirmed each workspace constructor creates a new UUID with no restored-id input.
Recovery therefore remains title-based.
The bundled Claude wrapper was observed stripping `CMUX_*` variables on its failed socket-probe path while retaining the app bundle id, supporting the macOS-only bundle-id and ancestry fallbacks.

```sh
tests/fm-backend-cmux.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-cmux-smoke.test.sh
```

The real smoke proves socket access, fresh readiness, current-path probing, send and keys, bounded capture, title identity, and guarded exact cleanup.

### Claude composer confirmation

The borderless Claude composer confirmation was verified on 2026-08-09 with cmux 0.64.22 build 102 and Claude Code 2.1.226 on macOS aarch64.
An isolated real Claude worker rendered a bare `❯` plus U+00A0 row between horizontal rules.
The cmux classifier returned `empty`, and one `fm-send.sh --resolve-key <key> ALBATROSS` command appended the matching `resolved` event before the worker reported completion.
The terminal capture contained exactly one submitted `❯ ALBATROSS` row.
Refresh this harness-dependent proof with an isolated cmux Claude worker before accepting a Claude or cmux upgrade:

```sh
FM_CMUX_CLAUDE_COMPOSER_LIVE=1 bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-cmux-claude-composer-live-e2e.test.sh
```

The portable classifier regression is `tests/fm-backend-cmux.test.sh`.

## Codex App host tools

A reusable Desktop host-tool smoke ran on 2026-07-06 against Codex Desktop bundle version 26.623.101652, build 4674, bundle id `com.openai.codex`.
Local paths and task-specific ids are intentionally not retained here.

The host-tool sequence was:

1. list a saved project;
2. create a Desktop-owned worktree thread;
3. recover and read the thread while active and after completion;
4. verify the thread appended a Firstmate status line and wrote its report;
5. send a follow-up to the same thread;
6. read the completed follow-up;
7. archive the exact thread;
8. read the archived transcript with state `notLoaded`.

Observed guarantee: a Desktop-owned thread can write Firstmate lifecycle files when the prompt provides an authorized absolute path, and create, send, read, and archive work at the Desktop host-tool layer.
The missing guarantee remains a supported shell-callable bridge that lets Firstmate perform those operations against the same visible Desktop endpoint.
App-server partial methods and raw socket experiments do not satisfy that bridge contract.
